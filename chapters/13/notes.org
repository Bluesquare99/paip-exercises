* Object Oriented Programming
The NEW-ACCOUNT function returns a closure over three variables (name, balance, and interest rate). It encapsulates five messages to which an object can respond. When you pass an ACCOUNT object a message, it returns a function. 


** Little Details
An *instance variable* is one that is encapsulated in an object. A *class variable*, on the other hand, is shared by all instances of a class.
